**Project Description**
Character encoding converter is a free tool that can be used to convert from one character encoding to another. The need for such a tool arose out of a vacuum of free easy to use GUI driven tools that can be used to convert multi gigabyte text files from one character encoding to another. 

The project has been built to support the Geonames Web API project. Geonames.org provides free geographic data dump that can be used in various applications that require geo-spatial capabilities. The data, natively is available in UTF-8 format and in order to for it to be pushed into SQL Server database, needs conversion in UTF-16 encoding. 

The converter does no in-memory conversion, hence can deal with multi-gigabyte sized text files. The converter uses default file encoding detection which sometimes falls short on expectations. Still trying to find a reliable way of solving this problem.
